# Fibre Optic Network Optimisation

A Kotlin-based desktop application to compute the optimal high-speed fibre-optic network between European capitals using a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST).

## ðŸ§  Project Summary

This project simulates a real-world telecoms network expansion scenario. Given a list of capital cities and distances between them, it:

- Loads and validates the CSV dataset.
- Represents the network as a weighted graph.
- Computes the **Minimum Spanning Tree** using **Primâ€™s Algorithm**.
- Displays the result both in tabular and **graphical visualisation**.
- Supports user queries for distances and connections between cities.

## âœ… Features

| Feature | Status | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| CSV File Upload | âœ… | Load city-to-city distance file (.txt in `City1,City2,Distance` format). |
| Graph Representation | âœ… | Graph structure built with nodes and edges (adjacency list). |
| MST Calculation | âœ… | Prim's Algorithm used to compute minimum cable length. |
| MST Visualisation | âœ… | JavaFX-based visual graph of the MST. |
| Distance Query | âœ… | Returns distance between two user-input cities. |
| Connection Lookup | âœ… | Shows all cities directly connected to a selected city. |
| Robust Error Handling | âœ… | Friendly error messages for invalid input, file issues, etc. |
